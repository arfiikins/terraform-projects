Automated Infrastructure Deployment with GitHub and AWS

Project Description:
Create an automated infrastructure deployment pipeline using Terraform, GitHub, and AWS. The pipeline will trigger whenever changes are pushed to a specific branch in a GitHub repository. Upon triggering, it will provision or update resources in AWS based on the changes made in the Terraform configurations.

Key Components:

GitHub Repository: Set up a GitHub repository to store your Terraform configurations. This repository will be the source of truth for your infrastructure code.

Terraform Configuration: Write Terraform configurations to define the infrastructure resources you want to provision in AWS. This could include EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM roles, VPCs, etc.

Terraform State Management: Configure Terraform to store its state in a remote backend, such as AWS S3 or Terraform Cloud, to enable collaboration and consistency across team members.

GitHub Actions: Set up GitHub Actions workflows to automate the deployment process. Define workflows that trigger on specific events, such as push to a specific branch, and execute Terraform commands to apply the infrastructure changes.

AWS Provider Configuration: Configure Terraform to authenticate with AWS using IAM credentials or assume IAM roles. Ensure that Terraform has the necessary permissions to provision resources in your AWS account.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Best Practices: Follow best practices for writing infrastructure code, such as modularization, parameterization, and versioning, to maintain a clean and maintainable codebase.

Project Steps:

Set up GitHub Repository: Create a new GitHub repository to host your Terraform configurations.

Write Terraform Configurations: Develop Terraform configurations to define the AWS resources you want to provision.

Configure Remote Backend: Set up a remote backend for Terraform state storage. This could be AWS S3 or Terraform Cloud.

Configure GitHub Actions: Create GitHub Actions workflows to automate the Terraform deployment process. Define workflow files (workflow.yml) to trigger on specific events and execute Terraform commands.

Configure AWS Provider: Configure Terraform to authenticate with AWS using IAM credentials or IAM roles. Ensure that Terraform has the necessary permissions to manage resources in your AWS account.

Testing and Deployment: Test your GitHub Actions workflows by pushing changes to the GitHub repository. Verify that the workflows trigger correctly and provision/update resources in AWS as expected.

Monitoring and Maintenance: Set up monitoring and logging for your infrastructure using AWS CloudWatch or other monitoring tools. Regularly review and update your Terraform configurations as your infrastructure requirements evolve.

By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with Terraform, GitHub, and AWS, as well as understanding how to automate infrastructure deployment pipelines using infrastructure as code (IaC) practices.
