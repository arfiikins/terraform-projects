# Automated Infrastructure Deployment with GitHub and AWS

## Project Description

This project aims to create an automated infrastructure deployment pipeline using Terraform, GitHub, and AWS. The pipeline will trigger whenever changes are pushed to a specific branch in a GitHub repository, provisioning or updating resources in AWS based on Terraform configurations.

## Key Components

1. **GitHub Repository**: Store Terraform configurations for infrastructure as code.

2. **Terraform Configuration**: Define infrastructure resources (e.g., EC2, S3) in Terraform.

3. **Terraform State Management**: Store Terraform state remotely for collaboration and consistency.

4. **GitHub Actions**: Automate deployment using GitHub Actions workflows.

5. **AWS Provider Configuration**: Configure Terraform to authenticate and provision resources in AWS.

6. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Best Practices**: Follow modularization, parameterization, and versioning for maintainable code.

## Project Steps

1. **Setup GitHub Repository**: Create a repository for Terraform configurations.

2. **Write Terraform Configurations**: Develop Terraform files defining AWS resources.

3. **Configure Remote Backend**: Setup remote backend (AWS S3 or Terraform Cloud) for Terraform state.

4. **Configure GitHub Actions**: Create workflows triggering Terraform commands on push events.

5. **Configure AWS Provider**: Authenticate Terraform with AWS and grant necessary permissions.

6. **Testing and Deployment**: Test workflows by pushing changes to the repository and verifying AWS resources.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Implement monitoring using AWS CloudWatch and update Terraform configurations as needed.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with Terraform, GitHub, and AWS, learning to automate infrastructure deployment pipelines through infrastructure as code practices.
